# Ship Physics

Some of this is from Wikipedia.

Ships of the period had two modes of locomotion, sail and oars. Each method has advantages and disadvantages

Oars:

 * Have a higher maximum speed, 18 m/sec
 * Have more acceleration.
 * Have a lot of steering authority, so the ship is far more maneuverable in close quarters
 * Rowed ships can turn on their center. Sailed ships have a minimum radius
 * Are easily damaged during an engagement
 * Prevent opponents boarding from the side until they're destroyed
 * Anyone rowing isn't fighting.
 * Rowing is hard work, the rowers get exhausted quickly
 * If your rowers are exhausted when you turn them into soldiers they're still exhausted
 * Ships in combat were mostly rowed
 * Rowing is actually a fairly complex skill. 

Sails:
 * Have a lower maximum speed
 * Over a long enough period, are faster - you can't keep rowing forever
 * Have a speed that varies with the wind and direction. Fastest is sideways and a little downwind.
 * Cannot sail into the wind more than about 30 degrees
 * When the boat changes from wind on one side to the other, the boat must 'tack' (swing the bow through upwind) or gybe (swing the bow through downwind). This means moving the sail, which means most of the crew is doing that, and drastically slows the boat for 10 seconds or so
 * When the boat wants to stop it also has to move the sail, which takes a lot of people
 * Are a great thing to hook onto with a grapple, and generally are this great big square above your ship
 * They make your ship keel over (roll over sideways so one side of the deck is higher). If you stop the ship goes back upright - not great motion while trying to board. You can counteract this with the rudder.
 * Ships traveling long distances were mostly sailed
 * The rudder controls turning moment on the ship. Most sailboats have a tendency to head into the wind when on a reach, so steering is actually slightly away
